- Document everything!
- Rename `basic_group::order()` to `size`?
- Rethink the memory management of basic_group objects passed to Direct's
  constructor
- Make the names of the methods for constructing arbitrary elements (currently
  Cyclic::residue and Direct::pair) consistent
- Rethink the way Element manages its Group*
- Could the creation of basic_group subclasses be simplified using templates
  and/or std::function somehow?
- Create a "smart pointer" container around basic_group<T>* for general
  external use?
- Rename "abelian" to "isAbelian"?
- Give `Group` a `Group(const basic_group<T>*)` constructor that uses/emulates
  either the `Group(const basic_group<T>&)` or `Group(const Group&)`
  constructor depending on what type the pointer points to
- Move `group_mismatch` to a header that's not for internal utilities
- Add an easy way to convert element values from T to Element and back again
 - Give `Element` an `Element(const basic_group<T>&, const T&)` constructor?
- Make Group subclass basic_group<Element> instead of specializing it in
  preparation for implementing subgroups
- Specialize basic_group<Permutation> as an abstract class that defines oper,
  invert, identity, & order(Permutation) and leaves the rest as pure virtual
- Add a header file that re-exports all of the other header files
- Give the various classes (especially Group) comparison operators that only
  work on values of the same type
 - cf. std::rel_ops in <utility>

FEATURES
- Implement all of the features in plan.txt
- Types of groups to implement:
 - the trivial group
 - Klein 4-group
 - semidirect products
 - alternating groups
 - permutation groups
 - multiplication modulo n
- Operations to add:
 - calculating group tables
 - calculating centralizers & centers
 - calculating normalizers
 - determining all subgroups of a group
 - determining whether a subgroup is normal
 - calculating nilpotence classes
 - calculating conjugacy classes
 - calculating all abelian groups of a given order
 - determining whether a group is abelian
 - calculating lower central series
- Add methods for configuring how to display the elements of a group:
 - setting the strings to display for generators and the identity
 - setting whether cyclic groups should use the notation $x^a$, $a$, $\bar{a}$,
   or $[a]_n$
 - setting whether direct product groups should use pair notation or just
   concatenate the element strings
  - when pair notation is used, setting whether elements of component direct
    product groups should be "flattened" or not (e.g., "((a, b), c)" vs. "(a,
    b, c)")
 - setting whether to display operations/combinations of generators additively
   or multiplicatively
 - setting whether to give $ab=c\in V_4$ and $ij=k\in Q_8$ separate symbols
   (and, if so, which ones) or to represent them as combinations of generators
 - setting what order to display factors of elements of semidirect products in
   (including elements of dihedral and dicyclic groups)
 - setting how to display i^n = j^2 in dicyclic groups
- Add an alternative to/replacement for quaternion() that takes the cardinality
  of the desired group?
- Add closure functions that send their output to supplied output iterators?
- Specialize C++11's `hash<T>` for Permutation.cpp?
- Add methods for showing names of groups
- Give the various `basic_group` subclasses getters for their constructor values
- Add a "conjugate" method
- Add a basic_element<basic_group<T>, T> class with multiplication et alii
  methods?
- Add an `isSubset(set<T>, basic_group<T>)` function?
- Add a utility function for outputting multiplication tables?
