- Document everything!
- Handle all of the sections marked "TODO" in the code
- Implement all of the features in plan.txt
 - Features that the Python version is behind on:
  - alternating groups
  - permutation groups
  - "boolean" group?
  - calculating all subgroups of a group
  - a "tabular" group
- Implement configurable element showing
- Implement Element construction of the form `Element(paramTuple, group)`
  (where Element is the base class rather than a group's derived class) ?
- Add __copy__ and __deepcopy__ methods (see the `copy` module)
 - Add Element.copy()
- Make `identity` a property?
- Rewrite Group.__contains__ and/or Group.elem to ensure that the Element
  objects in question actually appear in their respective Groups?  cf. the
  overloading of .elem by Cyclic
- Should .oper (and other Group methods?) raise a TypeError when given Elements
  outside the Group?
- permutation.py: Make fewer things properties?
- Add a way to set an individual group's __str__, __unicode__, & LaTeX values?
