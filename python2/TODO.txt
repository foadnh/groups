- Document everything!
- Handle all of the sections marked "TODO" in the code
- Implement all of the features in plan.txt
 - Features that the Python version is behind on:
  - alternating groups
  - permutation groups
  - "boolean" group?
  - a "tabular" group
- Implement configurable element showing
- Add __copy__ and __deepcopy__ methods (see the `copy` module)
 - Add Element.copy()
- Should .oper (and other group methods?) raise a TypeError/ValueError when
  given values outside the group?
- permutation.py: Make fewer things properties?
- Add a way to set an individual group's __str__, __unicode__, & LaTeX values?
- Give `group` a `generate` method that's like `closure` but returns a
  `subgroup`?
- Make `isSubgroup` behave intelligently when passed a `subgroup` object
