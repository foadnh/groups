- Document everything!
- Handle all of the sections marked "TODO" in the code
- Add a Makefile for dev/ and tests/
- Implement all of the features in plan.txt
 - Features that the Haskell version is behind on:
  - Converting elements to strings
  - Creating arbitrary elements of given groups (cf. `mkelem` in dev/misc.hs)
- Implement the following in Groups/Types/Subset.hs:
 - ss_fromIntSet :: Group -> IntSet -> Subset
 - conversion to & from [Int]
 - âˆˆ ???
- Rename `Elem` to `Element`?
- Prefix the `Group`, `Elem`, and `Subset` constructors with "Mk"?
- Make most(?) of the functions in `Ops.hs` that use `[Elem]`s use `Subset`s
  instead
- Idea: Get rid of `Groups.hs` and the re-exporting parts of `Types.hs`, and
  then rename the functions in `Group.hs`, `Elem.hs`, `Subset.hs`, & `Ops.hs`
  so that they all use the same (conflicting) names for the same things
- Consider giving Elem an Ix instance that yields nonempty lists only when the
  groups of the bounds match; this will then make it possible to implement a
  group table function with type `Group -> Array (Elem, Elem) Elem`
- Actually make `Group`'s constructor private -- without messing up the
  definition of `mkgroup`
