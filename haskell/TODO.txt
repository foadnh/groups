- Implement all of the features in plan.txt
 - Features that the Haskell version is behind on:
  - subgroups as a group type
  - converting elements to strings
  - creating arbitrary elements of given groups (cf. `mkelem` in dev/misc.hs)
  - testing whether a given function is a valid homomorphism
  - calculating left & right cosets of groups
  - generalized dihedral groups
  - quotient groups
- Make the `Group` constructor private?
- Add a function for testing whether a given subset is normal within another
  subset?
- Replace the "undefined"s in Families.hs with descriptive error messages
- Add a function for generating the Cayley table of a given group
- Replace permutation groups with subgroups of symmetric groups
